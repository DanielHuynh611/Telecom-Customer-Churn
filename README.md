# Telecom Customer Churn Drivers Analysis

## Project Background

Nexa, a telecommunications service provider, is facing increased competition, leading to a significant loss of customers.Data indicates that 26.5% of the customer base has churned, with half of them leaving due to the belief that competitors offer a better alternative. To address this challenge, a data-driven approach is essential to uncover key factors influencing customer churn. As a data scientist, my objective is to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns contributing to churn, and provide actionable insights to enhance retention strategies. 

## Business Question

The key churn factors being analyzed can be grouped into the following categories:

- **Service Offerings**: This analysis aims to answer the following questions:

  1. **Internet Service**: Do customers with internet service have lower churn rates? Which internet type retains customers best?
  2. **Payment Methods**: How does churn vary among Bank Withdrawal, Credit Card, and Mailed Check payments?
  3. **Contract Types**: How do churn rates compare across Month-to-Month, One-Year, and Two-Year contracts?
  4. **Additional Services**: Does subscribing to 'Online Backup,' 'Premium Tech Support,' or 'Unlimited Data' reduce churn?
 
- **Demographic factors**: These two questions will be addressed:

  1. **Age Groups**: Which age group—Under 30, 30-64, or Over 64—experiences the highest churn rate?

  2. **Marital Status**: Do married customers churn less frequently than single customers?
